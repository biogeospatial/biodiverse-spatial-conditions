# Introduction

Spatial conditions are core to the Biodiverse system.  They are used to specify both neighbourhoods used in the analyses, and also the definition queries used to restrict the calculations to a subset of groups.

This document provides an overview of using these conditions, lists the available conditions and describes how to use variables, both predefined and user defined.  

This document describes **version 5.0**

Biodiverse is a tool for the spatial analysis of biological and related diversity.
